# Rick and Morty Clicky Game

## Overview

This memory game was created with React and involved breaking up the application's UI into components, managing the component state, and responding to user events. The application renders different images Jerrys, Mortys and Ricks to the screen that listen for click events. The application tracks the user's score, which increments when an image is clicked for the first time. The user loses and their score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once. To make this game more challenging, every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. If the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
